# Frontend Mentor: FAQ Accordion 
This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-wyfFdeBwBz). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. My solution to the challenge can be viewed as a webpage [here](https://providence-herald.github.io/FAQ-Accordion-Frontend-Mentor/).

## Overview

The goal of this project was to build out a FAQ accordion and get it to look as close to the given design as possible. I could use any tools to help me complete the challenge. I chose to use SCSS to get some more practice with it. This is my second project using SCSS and I'm liking it more and more.

This project was the hardest one yet due to my non-existant JavaScript skills. I had to do a lot of reading and asked Chat-GPT for help so I'm not as satisfied with my work on this one. But I learned a lot. I learned about the event listeners DOMContentLoaded and keydown, how to toggle, how to add a class to an HTML element, and how to change the source of an image within JavaScript. I got more practice writing functions. I'm going to keep studying this and rebuild this accordion a few times to get these concepts to stick.
